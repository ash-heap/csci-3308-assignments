<p><b style="font-size: 2.25em; line-height: 1;">Part 1 - Classes</b></p>
<p><b><i>a)</i></b>: Create a class&nbsp;<code>Dessert</code>&nbsp;with getters and setters for&nbsp;<code>name</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>calories</code>. Define instance methods&nbsp;<code>healthy?</code>, which returns&nbsp;<code>true</code>&nbsp;if a dessert has less than 200 calories, and&nbsp;<code>delicious?</code>&nbsp;which returns&nbsp;<code>true</code>&nbsp;for all desserts.</p>
<p>Here is the framework:</p>
<pre>class Dessert
    def initialize(name, calories)
        # Your code here
    end

    def healthy?
        # Your code here
    end

    def delicious?
        # Your code here
    end
end</pre>
<p>Note: You may define additional helper methods.</p>
<p><b><i>b)</i></b>: Create a class&nbsp;<code>JellyBean</code>&nbsp;that extends&nbsp;<code>Dessert</code>, and add a getter and setter for&nbsp;<code>flavor</code>. Modify&nbsp;<code>delicious?</code>&nbsp;to return&nbsp;<code>false</code>&nbsp;if the flavor is "black licorice" (but&nbsp;<code>delicious?</code>&nbsp;should still return&nbsp;<code>true</code>&nbsp;for all other flavors and for all non-<code>JellyBean</code>&nbsp;desserts).</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>JellyBean</code>&nbsp;class should look like this:</p>
<pre>class JellyBean &lt; Dessert
    def initialize(name, calories, flavor)
        # Your code here
    end

    def delicious?
        # Your code here
    end
end</pre>
<p>Note: As before, you may define additional helper methods.</p>
<h2><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">**Note: Things start to get more difficult here**</span></em></h2>
<h1>Part 2 - Object Oriented Programming</h1>
<p>In lecture (Referring to the MOOC), we saw how&nbsp;<code>attr_accessor</code>&nbsp;uses metaprogramming to create getters and setters for object attributes on the fly.</p>
<p>Define a method&nbsp;<code>attr_accessor_with_history</code>&nbsp;that provides the same functionality as&nbsp;<code>attr_accessor</code>&nbsp;but also tracks every value the attribute has ever taken. The following example shows the basic behavior of the new accessor:</p>
<pre>class Foo
    attr_accessor_with_history :bar
end

f = Foo.new     # =&gt; #&lt;Foo:0x127e678&gt;
f.bar = 3       # =&gt; 3
f.bar = :wowzo  # =&gt; :wowzo
f.bar = 'boo!'  # =&gt; 'boo!'
f.bar_history   # =&gt; [nil, 3, :wowzo, 'boo!']</pre>
<p>Here are some hints and guidelines to get you rolling:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first thing to notice is that if we define&nbsp;<code>attr_accessor_with_history</code>&nbsp;in class&nbsp;<code>Class</code>, we can use it as in the snippet above. This is because, as ELLS mentions, a class in Ruby is simply an object of class<code>Class</code>. (If that makes your brain hurt, don't worry about it for now. It'll come eventually.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second thing to notice is that Ruby provides a method&nbsp;<code>class_eval</code>&nbsp;that takes a string and evaluates it in the context of the current class, that is, the class from which you're calling<code>attr_accessor_with_history</code>. This string will need to contain a method definition that implements a<code>setter-with-history</code>&nbsp;for the desired attribute&nbsp;<code>attr_name</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>#bar_history</code>&nbsp;should always return an&nbsp;<code>Array</code>&nbsp;of elements, even if no values have been assigned yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't forget that the very first time the attribute receives a value, its history array will have to be initialized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't forget that instance variables are referred to as&nbsp;<code>@bar</code>&nbsp;within getters and setters, as explained in Section 3.4 of ELLS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the existing&nbsp;<code>attr_accessor</code>&nbsp;can handle multiple arguments (e.g.&nbsp;<code>attr_accessor :foo, :bar</code>), your version just needs to handle a single argument. However, it should be able to track multiple instance variables per class, with any legal class names or variable names, so it should work if used this way:</p>
<pre>class SomeOtherClass
    attr_accessor_with_history :foo
    attr_accessor_with_history :bar
end</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>History of instance variables should be maintained separately for each object instance. That is, if you do</p>
<pre>f = Foo.new
f.bar = 1
f.bar = 2
f = Foo.new
f.bar = 4
f.bar_history</pre>
then the last line should return&nbsp;<code>[nil, 4]</code>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<code>[nil, 1, 2, 4]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the skeleton to get you started:</p>
<pre>class Class
    def attr_accessor_with_history(attr_name)
        attr_name = attr_name.to_s       # make sure it's a string
        attr_reader attr_name            # create the attribute's getter
        attr_reader attr_name+"_history" # create bar_history getter
        class_eval "your code here, use %Q for multiline strings"
    end
end

class Foo
    attr_accessor_with_history :bar
end</pre>
<p>Example test case:</p>
<pre>f = Foo.new
f.bar = 1
f.bar = 2
f.bar_history # =&gt; if your code works, should be [nil, 1, 2]</pre>
<h1>Part 3 - More OOP</h1>
<p><b><i>a) — Currency conversion (ELLS 3.11)</i></b>: Extend the currency-conversion example from lecture so that code such as the following will work:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>5.dollars.in(:euros)</code></li>
<li><code>10.euros.in(:rupees)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You should support the currencies&nbsp;<code>dollars</code>,&nbsp;<code>euros</code>,&nbsp;<code>rupees</code>,&nbsp;<code>yen</code>&nbsp;where the conversions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rupees</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>dollars</code>, multiply by 0.019,</li>
<li><code>yen</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>dollars</code>, multiply by 0.013,</li>
<li><code>euro</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>dollars</code>, multiply by 1.292.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the singular and plural forms of each currency should be acceptable, e.g.&nbsp;<code>1.dollar.in(:rupees)</code>&nbsp;and<code>10.rupees.in(:euro)</code>&nbsp;should work.</p>
<p>You can use the code shown in lecture as a starting point if you wish. It is repeated below:</p>
<pre>class Numeric
 @@currencies = {'yen' =&gt; 0.013, 'euro' =&gt; 1.292, 'rupee' =&gt; 0.019}
 def method_missing(method_id)
   singular_currency = method_id.to_s.gsub( /s$/, '')
   if @@currencies.has_key?(singular_currency)
     self * @@currencies[singular_currency]
   else
     super
   end
 end
end
</pre>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>b) — Palindromes</i></b>: Adapt your solution from the "palindromes" question so that instead of writing&nbsp;<code>palindrome?("foo")</code>&nbsp;you can write&nbsp;<code>"foo".palindrome?</code>&nbsp;(Hint: this should require fewer than 5 lines of code.)</p>
<p><b><i>c) — Palindromes again</i></b>: Adapt your palindrome solution so that it works on&nbsp;<code>Enumerables</code>. That is:<br><code>[1,2,3,2,1].palindrome? # =&gt; true</code></p>
<p>It's not necessary for the collection's elements to be palindromes themselves--only that the top-level collection be a palindrome. (Hint: this should require fewer than 5 lines of code.) Although hashes are considered&nbsp;<code>Enumerables</code>, your solution does not need to work with hashes, though it should not error.</p>
<h1>Part 4 - Blocks</h1>
<p>Given two collections (of possibly different lengths), we want to get the Cartesian product of the sequences. A Cartesian product is a sequence that enumerates every possible pair from the two collections, where the pair consists of one element from each collection. For example, the Cartesian product (denoted by ×) of the sequences&nbsp;<code>a = [:a, :b, :c]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>b = [4, 5]</code>&nbsp;is:</p>
<pre>a × b = [ [:a,4], [:a,5], [:b,4], [:b,5], [:c,4], [:c,5] ]</pre>
<p>Create a constructor for the class&nbsp;<code>CartesianProduct</code>&nbsp;that that takes two sequences as arguments, these values will define the behavior of your object. Define&nbsp;<code>each</code>&nbsp;as an instance method for&nbsp;<code>CartesianProduct</code>. Your method should return an iterator which yields the cartesian product of the two sequences used in the class' constructor. The iterator should yield the values one at a time as 2 element arrays.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what order the elements are returned in. So for the above example, the ordering<code>[ [:a,4], [:b,4], [:c,4], [:a,5], [:b,5], [:c,5] ]</code>&nbsp;would be correct as well.</p>
<p>It does matter that within each pair, the order of the elements matches the order in which the original sequences were provided. That is,&nbsp;<code>[:a,4]</code>&nbsp;is a member of the Cartesian product&nbsp;<code>a × b</code>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<code>[4,:a]</code>&nbsp;is not. (Instead,&nbsp;<code>[4,:a]</code>&nbsp;is a member of the Cartesian product&nbsp;<code>b × a</code>.)</p>
<p>Below is the code skeleton:</p>
<pre>class CartesianProduct
    include Enumerable
    # Your code here
end</pre>
<p>Example test cases:</p>
<pre>c = CartesianProduct.new([:a,:b], [4,5])
c.each { |elt| puts elt.inspect }
# [:a, 4]
# [:a, 5]
# [:b, 4]
# [:b, 5]

c = CartesianProduct.new([:a,:b], [])
c.each { |elt| puts elt.inspect }
# Nothing printed since Cartesian product of anything with an empty collection is empty</pre></div>
